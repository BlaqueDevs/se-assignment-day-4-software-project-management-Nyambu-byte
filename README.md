## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Comparison and Contrast
Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach. The development process flows in one direction—downward like a waterfall. Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, where development is broken down into smaller cycles called sprints (usually 2-4 weeks)
Waterfall is rigid. Once a phase is completed, it is difficult to go back and make changes while Agile is flexible and encourages changes even late in the development process.
Upfront planning is a hallmark of Waterfall. All requirements are gathered at the beginning, and detailed planning is done before development begins while Continuous planning is essential in Agile. Requirements are gathered incrementally throughout the project, and adjustments can be made at any point based on feedback and evolving needs.
In Waterfall, communication with stakeholders is more limited, generally occurring during the requirements gathering phase and then during testing or delivery. In Agile, frequent communication with stakeholders is integral. The team interacts with stakeholders regularly—often at the end of every sprint—through reviews and feedback sessions, ensuring the product evolves in line with stakeholder needs.
Testing is done after the development phase in Waterfall. Since testing occurs after the build, bugs or issues can be more costly to fix. In Agile methodology, testing is done continuously throughout the process. Every sprint includes planning for and conducting testing, allowing issues to be identified early and addressed immediately, which results in better overall product quality.
Advantages of Agile methodologies
1. Adaptability to changing requirements.
